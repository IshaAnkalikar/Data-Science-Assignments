        "Association between Device Type and Customer Satisfaction\n",
        "Background:\n",
        "Mizzare Corporation has collected data on customer satisfaction levels for two types of smart home devices: Smart Thermostats and Smart Lights. They want to determine if there's a significant association between the type of device purchased and the customer's satisfaction level.\n",
        "Data Provided:\n",
        "The data is summarized in a contingency table showing the counts of customers in each satisfaction level for both types of devices:\n",
        "Satisfaction\tSmart Thermostat\tSmart Light\tTotal\n",
        "Very Satisfied\t50\t70\t120\n",
        "Satisfied\t80\t100\t180\n",

        "Very Unsatisfied\t20\t50\t70\n",
        "Total\t240\t360\t600\n",
        "Objective:\n",
        "To use the Chi-Square test for independence to determine if there's a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased (Smart Thermostats vs. Smart Lights) and the customer satisfaction level.\n",
        "Assignment Tasks:\n",
        "1. State the Hypotheses:\n",
        "2. Compute the Chi-Square Statistic:\n",
        "3. Determine the Critical Value:\n",
        "Using the significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and the degrees of freedom (which is the number of categories minus 1)\n",
        "4. Make a Decision:\n",
        "Compare the Chi-Square statistic with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "Submission Guidelines:\n",
        "Provide a detailed report of your analysis, including each step outlined in the assignment tasks in a python file.\n",
        "Include all calculations, the Chi-Square statistic, the critical value, and your conclusion."
